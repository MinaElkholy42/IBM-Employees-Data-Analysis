Analysis of the rate of turnover of IBM Employees from last year.

Employees are the backbone of any organization. Its performance is heavily based on the quality of the
employees and retaining them. With employee attrition, organizations are faced with several
challenges:
1. Expensive in terms of both money and time to train new employees
2. Loss of experienced employees
3. Impact on productivity
4. Impact on profit This dataset is from IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance. 
 
It has 35 features describing each employeeâ€™s background and characteristics and is labeled with whether they are still in the company or whether they have gone to work somewhere else. 
Exploratory data analysis can help to understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition.

so there is a need to provide key insights on the current HR scheme and does it impact attrition rates. 
And a need to define a KPI that is likely to be critical in predicting employee stability.

The process was done using the HR Analysis Excel File, Excel Functions, and Techniques to analyze the data.
